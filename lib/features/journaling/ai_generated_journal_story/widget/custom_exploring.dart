I woke up early one morning to hike through the Fushimi Inari shrine, passing under thousands of bright torii gates. It felt spiritual â€” like the mountain was guiding me toward something peaceful within.\n\nOne of the most unexpected highlights was attending a local summer matsuri (festival) in a small town near Osaka. Children ran through the streets with paper fans, fireworks painted the night sky, and I tried my first ever takoyaki. The heat was intense, but every sweaty moment was worth it.",
